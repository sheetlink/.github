  ## Design Principles

  SheetLink is built on three core values:
  - **Transparency**: Your data, your sheet, your control.
  - **Security**: Zero-knowledge local processing where possible, encrypted transport, and bank-grade best practices.
  - **Simplicity**: A lightweight, intuitive workflow that keeps your personal finance clear and flexible.
